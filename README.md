Project Title: Employee Management System

Description:
Developed a robust Full Stack Web Application using Java Spring Boot. The system includes a hierarchical role structure, with a Super Admin approving Admin requests. Admins can perform CRUD operations on employee records, stored in a MySQL database. Employees undergo email verification and gain access to their details. Super Admin has control over all registered admins, including approval and deletion of Admins. The application promotes efficient employee management, ensuring secure access and streamlined administrative processes.
